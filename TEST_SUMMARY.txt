UNIT TESTS ADDED TO YOUR UNITY GAME
================================================================================

✅ TESTS CREATED:
  - BattleManagerTests.cs (15 tests)
  - PlayerMovementsTests.cs (14 tests)
  Total: 29 unit tests

✅ FILES ADDED:
  Assets/Tests/Editor/BattleManagerTests.cs
  Assets/Tests/Editor/PlayerMovementsTests.cs
  Assets/Tests/README.md
  TESTING.md (Quick start guide)
  TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md (Best practices guide)

================================================================================
HOW TO RUN TESTS IN UNITY:
================================================================================

1. Open your project in Unity Editor
2. Go to: Window → Testing → Test Runner
3. Select "EditMode" tab
4. Click "Run All" button
5. Watch tests execute in the Test Runner window

Alternative: Click on individual tests to run them separately

================================================================================
WHAT'S TESTED:
================================================================================

BATTLE SYSTEM (BattleManagerTests):
  ✓ Initial health values (player: 100, enemy: 80)
  ✓ Initial mana values (player: 50)
  ✓ Health bar initialization
  ✓ Damage calculations
  ✓ Mana cost for magic attacks
  ✓ Magic attack damage (strength + 10)
  ✓ Enemy health reduction
  ✓ Player health reduction
  ✓ Mana availability checks
  ✓ Victory conditions (enemy defeated)
  ✓ Defeat conditions (player defeated)
  ✓ Multiple mana spends
  ✓ Attack damage values
  ✓ Enemy damage range (10-30)

PLAYER MOVEMENT (PlayerMovementsTests):
  ✓ Default movement speed (5f)
  ✓ Component initialization
  ✓ Rigidbody2D existence
  ✓ Speed modification capability
  ✓ Speed bounds validation
  ✓ Movement vector calculations
  ✓ Position tracking
  ✓ Collision detection setup
  ✓ Physics configuration

================================================================================
FRAMEWORK USED:
================================================================================

- NUnit (included with Unity Test Framework)
- Unity Test Framework 1.5.1 (already in your project)
- Test Platform: Editor Mode (no scene needed)

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS:
================================================================================

1. Run the tests to verify they work
2. Add tests for other scripts:
   - EnemyDetection.cs
   - IntroDialogue.cs
   - EndDialogue.cs
   - Quitapp.cs

3. Consider refactoring coroutines for better testability
4. Aim for 70%+ code coverage
